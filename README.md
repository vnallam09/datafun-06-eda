## Explore Datasets

Choose a dataset for analysis.
You will want a known, clean dataset. 
Cleaning data can run 60-80% of the project (or more) - you don't need to
demonstrate cleaning skills for this project.  
The recommended approach is to select one of the other pre-installed datasets in Seaborn.
You can view a list of the Seaborn datasets in the first link below. 
The additional links offer a range of options.
